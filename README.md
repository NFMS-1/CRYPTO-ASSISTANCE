# CRYPTO-ASSISTANCE

### 1. Setting up
> Make sure to enable your DM permissions (or temporarily enable them) so the crypto bot (tip.cc) can privately message you to handle transactions.
>
> **Q:** Why should I use tip.cc when I can just send the funds directly?
> **A:** Bitcoin transactions are traceable. Using the bot as an intermediary adds an extra layer of privacy by hiding personal wallet addresses, enhancing anonymity.
> 
> **Q:** What about Monero?
> **A:** For Monero users, I offer an alternative that allows you to send funds directly to a node instead of using the bot.

### 2. Depositing Funds
> 1. Click on the **tip.cc** bot in the server to open a private chat (since the server does not support public chat).
> 2. Type `$deposit btc`. A pop-up will appear with a QR code and BTC address. You can use third-party services like Coinbase to deposit the funds.

### 3. Orders
> Using the funds, you can purchase products from [the shop](https://discord.com/channels/890594623347650560/890602478280773642) by typing the command `$tip @nfms <amount>` in [your orders](https://discord.com/channels/890594623347650560/1214622711322779769).
> 
> The process works similarly to how transactions are done on TOR. If you're familiar with it, you'll understand how it works. It might feel a bit challenging the first time, but once you get used to it, itâ€™s straightforward.
